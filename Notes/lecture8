   i should explore it deeper when i restart reading deeplearningbook

Q:
  The multiplicative factors described in the lecture are an alternative to simply
   letting the input character choose the hidden-to-hidden weight matrix. In the

  lecture, it was explained that that simple model would have 86 x 1500 x 1500 =
  193 500 000 parameters, to specify how the hidden units and the input

  character at time t influence the hidden units at time t+1. How many parameters
  does the model with the factors have for that same purpose,

  i.e. for specifying how the hidden units and the input character at time t influence
  the hidden units at time t+1? Let's say that there are

  1500 hidden units, 86 different input characters, and 1500 factors.
A:
  for each factor:
  86 parameters from input to hidden +
  1500 parameters from current hidden to incoming +
  1500 parameters from hidden to output
