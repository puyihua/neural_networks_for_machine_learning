# Neural Networks for Machine Learning - Geoffrey Hinton
## Lecture 9 Notes by pyh

### something about prevent **overfitting**
  * more data
  * the right model capacity
  * average the result from different models or *bagging data*
  * *Bayesian* Use a single neural network architecture, but average the predictions made by many different weight vectors.



### how to choose **Hyperparameter**ï¼Ÿ
  * divide data in to *train*,*validation*, and *test*.
  * N-fold cross-validation

They are sophisticated and intricate.

The best way master it is to revise the lecture 9 Page 19 again.

And I will continue to explore a few days later, perhaps with the book *the methods for statistical learning* by Hang Li.
